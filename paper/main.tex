% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{Wearable fall detection systems face a fundamental challenge: while gyroscope data provides valuable orientation information, naively combining it with accelerometer data degrades performance due to noise contamination. We present a dual-stream transformer architecture addressing this through two innovations. First, we employ Kalman sensor fusion to transform noisy gyroscope angular velocities into stable orientation estimates (roll, pitch, yaw), producing semantically meaningful features capturing body pose during falls. Second, we process accelerometer and orientation streams through separate encoder pathways before fusion, preventing cross-modal interference. Our architecture incorporates Squeeze-and-Excitation channel attention and Temporal Attention Pooling to focus on fall-critical temporal patterns. Evaluated on the SmartFallMM dataset using 21-fold Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation, our dual-stream Kalman transformer achieves 91.10\% F1 score, outperforming single-stream Kalman transformers (89.80\% F1) by 1.30\% and single-stream baseline transformers (88.96\% F1) by 2.14\%. Critically, Kalman fusion drives a 3.52\% F1 improvement in dual-stream architectures by turning noisy gyroscope data into robust, usable orientation features. These results establish a new state-of-the-art for inertial measurement unit-based fall detection on commodity wearable devices.}
